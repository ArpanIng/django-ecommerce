"""
context_processors is a list of dotted Python paths to callables that are used to
populate the context when a template is rendered with a request.
These callables take a request object as their argument and return a dict of items
to be merged into the context.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/api/#built-in-template-context-processors


A context processor has a simple interface: itâ€™s a Python function that takes one argument,
an HttpRequest object, and returns a dictionary that gets added to the template context.
Each context processor must return a dictionary.
